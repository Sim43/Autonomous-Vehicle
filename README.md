# üöó Autonomous Vehicle System

This project implements a real-time autonomous vehicle control system using computer vision and deep learning. It combines **lane detection**, **YOLO-based object detection**, **decision-making**, and **ESP32-based motor control** through UART communication.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- **Camera-based Lane Detection**
  - Uses OpenCV to detect lanes and compute vehicle's offset from center.
  - Supports two different lane detection versions: `v1` and `v2`.

- **YOLOv5 Object Detection**
  - Detects obstacles (cars, pedestrians, signs).
  - Calculates approximate distance to detected objects.

- **Autonomous Decision Making**
  - Decides when to accelerate, brake, or perform lane change maneuvers.
  - Performs safe lane change if object is too close.

- **ESP32 Motor Control (UART)**
  - Sends steering, acceleration, and braking commands to ESP32 microcontrollers via UART.
  - ESPs control the vehicle's motors and actuators.

- **Logging**
  - Logs driving behavior, decisions, lane offset, object distance, and ESP states to CSV.

## üì∏ Camera Calibration (Required First Step)

Before running the main driving script:

1. Perform **camera calibration** to obtain:
   - Intrinsic matrix
   - Distortion coefficients

2. Save calibration results (used inside lane detection pipeline).

---

## üîå ESP Setup

1. Upload the provided **ESP32 motor control firmware** to your ESP boards.
2. Run the port detection script to create consistent symlinks:

```bash
python Hardware/tests/detect_ports.py
```
This will allow the system to communicate with the correct ESP devices via `/dev/esp_accel`, `/dev/esp_brake`, etc.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the System

Use the `play.py` script to run the full system:

```bash
python play.py --video 0 --esp --ldv 2
```
### Arguments

- `--video`: Camera index (e.g. `0`) or path to video file  
- `--esp`: Enables communication with ESP motor controllers  
- `--ldv`: Lane detection version (`1` or `2`). Default is `2`  
- `--reverse`: Reverses steering direction (if needed)
